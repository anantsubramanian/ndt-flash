In\n some cases the server can generate data faster than it can send packets\n into the network (e.g., a 2 GHz CPU sending to a DSL connected client).\n When this happens, some packets may remain in the server output queue\n when the 10 second timer expires.  TCP will automatically continue to\n send these queued packets and the client will continue to accept and\n process these incoming packets.
