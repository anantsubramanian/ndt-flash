ndt-flash is a Flash implementation of the NDT client.
NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool) is a client/server program that provides network
configuration and performance testing to end-users' desktop, laptop, and mobile
platforms.

How to compile :
1. Download the latest Flex SDK from http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html
2. Change the current working directory to the location of this README file.
3. Calling mxmlc from the command line :
i. If on Linux or Mac:
   Call the mxmlc in the bin directory of the Flex SDK by passing the Flex configuration 
   file ndt-flash-config.xml and src/Main.as as arguments :

   {path-to-flex-sdk}/bin/mxmlc src/Main.as -o <Insert_Filename_Here>.swf -load-config+=ndt-flash-config.xml

   Make sure to append ndt-flash-config.xml to -load-config instead of simply equating
   to ensure the default flex-config.xml file is also loaded as ndt uses crucial properties
   from that file as well.
   
ii.If on Windows :
   Call the mxmlc.exe in the bin directory of the Flex SDK by passing the ndt-flash-config.xml
   and src/Main.as files as arguments : 
   
   {path-to-flex-sdk}\bin\mxmlc.exe src\Main.as -o <Insert_Filename_Here>.swf -load-config+=ndt-flash-config.xml
  
   Make sure to append ndt-flash-config.xml to -load-config instead of simply equating
   to ensure the default flex-config.xml file is also loaded as ndt uses crucial properties
   from that file as well.
   
4. If there are no compilation errors, your compiled SWF should be created in the current
   working directory.
