ndt-flash is a Flash implementation of the NDT client.
NDT (Network Diagnostic Tool) is a client/server program that provides network
configuration and performance testing to end-users' desktop, laptop, and mobile
platforms.

How to compile :
1. Download the latest Flex SDK from http://www.adobe.com/devnet/flex/flex-sdk-download.html
2. Change the current working directory to the location of this README file.
3. Create frameworks for the missing locales :
   Call the copylocale in the bin directory of the Flex SDK to create frameworks for the
   missing locales as below (You should repeat for any locales you want to add other than
   the default flex supported ones) :
   
   i. If on Linux/Mac :
   {path-to-flex-sdk}/bin/copylocale en_US ca_ES
   {path-to-flex-sdk}/bin/copylocale en_US el_GR
   
   ii.If on Windows :
   {path-to-flex-sdk}\bin\copylocale.exe en_US ca_ES
   {path-to-flex-sdk}\bin\copylocale.exe en_US el_GR
   
4. Calling mxmlc from the command line :
   Call the mxmlc in the bin directory of the Flex SDK by passing the Flex configuration 
   file ndt-flash-config.xml and Main.as as arguments :
  
   i. If on Linux/Mac :
   {path-to-flex-sdk}/bin/mxmlc src/Main.as -o <Insert_Filename_Here>.swf -load-config+=ndt-flash-config.xml
   
   ii.If on Windows :
   {path-to-flex-sdk}\bin\mxmlc.exe src\Main.as -o <Insert_Filename_Here>.swf -load-config+=ndt-flash-config.xml
   
   Make sure to append ndt-flash-config.xml to -load-config instead of simply equating
   to ensure the default flex-config.xml file is also loaded as ndt uses crucial properties
   from that file as well.
   
4. If there are no compilation errors, your compiled SWF should be created in the current
   working directory.
